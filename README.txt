Simple parser for a small project, which was aimed to take popular new posts from vk, instagram and youtube into a single database.
As a temporary solution for testing mobile app storage also duplicated to a json file, hosted on a ftp server. 
App logs in using tokens to then parse recent posts and check if there are new ones which would pass some threshold of likes or views.
App was hosted on a free platform "appharbor.com" as a background worker. 
It was a testing prototype with *a lot* of weak/dangerous places and was never supposed to see the light of production, at least in the form it was.
